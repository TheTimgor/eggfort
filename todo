x implemented
/ decided against
(changed implementation)

world setup:
    x /gameinit
    x place worldborder
        x 1200 blocks dia
            (configurable!)
    x place eggs
        x 400 blocks from center, at surface level
            (dia/3)
        x on bedrock platform
    split players into teams
    / set team spawnpoints
        / some set distance from egg?

x all play:
    x prohibit setting spawn w/ bed
        (spawn can be set normally, but respawn during defense mode is in neutral territory)
    x remove default actions for egg
        x does not tp
        x unpushable
        x unbreakable
        / maybe indestructible entity that just looks like egg?

egg defense portion:
    x /defensestart
    maybe trigger at fixed time to prevent admin cheese?
    x team territory
        x 3 equal strips |  team 1 | neutral | team 2  |
    x on block place:
        x if on team territory:
            x place tnt places lit tnt entity
            x place fire places fire
            x water buckets
            x lava buckets
            x block all other events
    x on block break:
        x if on team territory:
            x water buckets
            x lava buckets
                (buckets can remove liquid blocks but do not store in bucket)
    egg behavior
        x 10 ? minute timer
        select random resource w/ amount
        keep counter for each player on how many collected
        on player r-click:
            if same team:
                check if they have counter = amount
                then, check if they have amount in inv
                remove amount from inv, reset timer + resource
            if different team:
                egg is captured, team wins
        if timer reaches 10 min, stop game
